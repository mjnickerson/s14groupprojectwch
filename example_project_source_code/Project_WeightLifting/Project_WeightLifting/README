The Dual_SensorTile_Acquire.sh system is developed to enable simultaneous data 
acqusisition from dual SensorTile systems.

To avoid resource conflict limitations, this system is designed to start two
data acquisition sessions with a 1 second delay in execution.

Dual_SensorTile_Acquisition.sh will first call motion_data_sensortile_1.sh at 
TRIGGER_TIME, and then call motion_data_sensortile_2.sh at TRIGGER_TIME2, which 
is TRIGGER_TIME+1. 

There is, therefore, a one second time offset between SensorTile 1 and Sensor-Tile 2
data acquisition processes.

This synchronization may then be corrected according to sample times after data
acquisition is complete by the applications using the acquired data.

By default settings, SensorTile 1 will stop when SensorTile 2 stops.

Thus SensorTile 1 will acquire more data than for SensorTile 2. 

The Dual_SensorTile_Acquisition.sh script then continues to execute sample_sync.c

This routine determines the difference between sample count between the two acquired
data files.

Any difference in sample count results from differences in the start time of 
acquisition by the two SensorTiles.

Synchronization is enabled by removing samples from the file of greater length 
to account for the difference in start time.

The two output files, motion_data_output_1.csv and motion_data_output_2.csv
contain synchronized data.
